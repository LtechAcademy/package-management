sonarqube: 
DevOps = development plus operations.    
devlopers and operators .... software development. 
software development :
planning ----- (features and code writing)
build 
test  ----- sonarqube... 
QA=  Testing of software...
e.g: we are devloping zoom apps. 
500.000 lines of code....
what would be the impact on end users.
How effective is this approach...
.............................
running a restaurant:
rice and stew:
servering --- 100 customers....
rice always comes with sand and insects inside  ---- bugs.--- defects....
hence we cant serve the customer...
Assume picking out the sand and insect separately and manaully..
No...
...........................
if we had a machine that  filters  rice from particle.......
Rice farms to have a quality proccess :
Automatic count/ an effective scale...
we are sure that quantity being is accurate..
sure that they are no bugs or sands/insects/particles in the rice... 

SONARQUBE:
avoid shipping\producing poor quality applications........
code coverage ...
1m lines of code...
sonarqube is compartible with serveral programming languages..
java
python 
php
c#
nodes...
.........................................
deploying to sonarqube: 
mvn sonar:sonar
Before deploying we need authenticate with sonarqube. 
we authenticate using the pom.xml file.
